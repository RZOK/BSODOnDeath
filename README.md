# BSODOnDeath
A tModLoader mod for Terraria 1.3.5 that causes your PC to bluescreen whenever you die.

This is not a joke.

It will ***actually*** bluescreen your computer.

Does not work on Mac or Linux.

There's also a more tame version of the mod, [RestartOnDeath](https://github.com/RZOK/RestartOnDeath).

Inspiration and BSOD trigger code came from this: https://github.com/realityquintupled/BeatSaber-BSODOnMiss
